The IT field is unique in its own way, but it’s driven by customer service. While the standards of professional business conversations generally apply, there is also the unique aspect of the technician possessing “special knowledge” that a more senior professional may not possess. For example, a person whose computer you are there to fix may be a senior manager at your company, but they may have no idea about how to fix computers. You must, then, remain calm and measured in responding to the client’s needs, yet remain authoritative in your body of knowledge and procedures. This can be difficult for new technicians. Remember, always be kind and patient: the client needs your help! \n 翻譯: \n 我們需要意識到的第一件事是，在信息技術（IT）領域中的工作正在在客戶服務領域中。IT領域以其自己的方式是獨特的，但它是由客戶服務驅動的。儘管通常會使用專業商務對話的標準，但技術人員還有一個獨特之處，那就是擁有“專業知識”的技術人員可能沒有更高級的專業人員具備。例如，您要修理計算機的人可能是您公司的高級經理，但他們可能不知道如何修理計算機。然後，您必須保持冷靜並在回應客戶需求時保持冷靜，同時在您的知識和程序方面保持權威。對於新技術人員而言，這可能很困難。記住，永遠要仁慈和耐心：客戶需要您的幫助！ \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Operational Procedures.html'}, {'title': 'Customer Service Key Principles', 'text': '客戶服務關鍵原則 \n \n 原文: \n Employers have indicated that there are several key principles to follow when handling customers to ensure that you are providing a positive customer service experience. \n Truly exceptional customer service involves surprising and delighting the customer by exceeding his or her expectations. Good customer service includes the following key elements: \n 翻譯: \n 雇主表示，在處理客戶時要遵循幾個關鍵原則，以確保您提供積極的客戶服務體驗。 \n 真正出色的客戶服務涉及超出客戶期望的驚喜和喜悅。 良好的客戶服務包括以下關鍵要素： \n \n Effective listening. \n Taking ownership of the situation. (掌握情況) \n Apologizing when appropriate. (適當的道歉) \n Remaining courteous and professional in all situations. (在任何況下都能保持專業和專業) \n Handling situations in a timely manner. (及時處理情況) \n Ensuring customers’ issues are resolved. (確保解決客戶的問題) \n Checking back with customers to ensure the problem was resolved to their satisfaction. (與客戶核對，以確保問題得到了滿意的解決) \n \n 原文: \n As a  technician , depending on where you work, you will find that sometimes your customers are your company’s clients, and sometimes your customers are other employees at the company you work for. Whether they work for the same company that you do, are clients for your company, or are private individuals relying on your company, the same principles of customer service apply. \n 翻譯: 作為技術人員，根據您在哪里工作，您會發現有時您的客戶是您公司的客戶，有時您的客戶是您所在公司的其他員工。無論他們與您在同一家公司工作，是您公司的客戶，還是依靠您公司的私人個人，都適用相同的客戶服務原則。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Customer Service Key Principles.html'}, {'title': 'Effective Listening', 'text': '原文: \n This principle is one of the most important elements in the ability of an employee to deliver outstanding customer service. Effective listening involves paying careful attention to what the customer is saying and watching the customer’s body language (if the encounter is in person) to detect the nonverbal cues that give clues as to what the customer is thinking and feeling. \n 翻譯: \n 該原則是員工提供出色客戶服務能力中最重要的要素之一。 有效的聆聽包括認真注意客戶在說什麼，並觀看客戶的肢體語言（如果是面對面的話），以發現非語言線索，從而提供有關客戶在想什麼和感覺的線索。 \n \n 原文: \n An effective listener is able to ask clarifying questions to help define the situation. At the end of the exchange, the employee should be able to clearly restate what the real problem is and what the customer is asking the company to do in response. \n 翻譯: \n 有效的傾聽者能夠提出明確的問題，以幫助確定情況。 在交換結束時，員工應該能夠清楚地說明真正的問題是什麼，以及客戶要求公司做些什麼作為回應。 \n (參考 Listening skills ) \n 原文: \n When effective listening is used properly, customers will feel that you are empathizing with them and will think that you understand their situation. Truly empathizing with a customer means that you are able to mentally place yourself in the customer’s situation and understand what the customer is actually feeling at that time. An employee who has the ability to recognize and acknowledge the customer’s concerns as though the employee were actually walking in the customer’s shoes is empathizing with the customer. Employees may establish a connection with customers by sharing their own similar experiences and letting the customers know, “I understand how hard this must be for you right now.” Empathy goes beyond sympathy. \n Here are several examples of empathetic statements that can create a connection with a customer in a positive way: \n 翻譯: \n 正確使用有效的聆聽後，客戶會覺得您對他們很同情，並認為您了解他們的處境。 真正地同情客戶意味著您能夠在心理上將自己置於客戶的處境中，並了解客戶當時的實際感受。 能夠識別並確認客戶的顧慮的員工，就好像該員工實際上是在走路時一樣。 員工可以通過分享自己的相似經歷並讓客戶知道“我知道現在這對您來說有多麼艱辛”，可以與客戶建立聯繫。 同情超越同情。 \n 以下是移情聲明的幾個示例，這些示例可以以積極的方式與客戶建立聯繫: \n \n \n I am sorry the power is out right now. It is such a hot day and I know that it must be frustrating for you. Our company is working hard to restore power in your area so that you can have air conditioning again soon. \n 很抱歉，目前電源已經關閉。天氣真熱，我知道那一定會讓您感到沮喪。我們公司正在努力恢復您所在地區的電源，以便您可以很快再次使用空調。 \n \n \n I know how frightening it must have been when the plane experienced bad turbulence on that last flight. I get somewhat anxious when I fly and I really hate it when the ride is bumpy.\n 我知道當飛機在最後一次飛行中遇到嚴重的湍流時，一定會感到多麼恐懼。我飛行時會有些焦慮，而當飛機顛簸時我真的很討厭它。 \n \n You must be very frustrated that your computer can’t connect to the Internet. I need Internet access for almost everything that I do, so I know how hard it is to try to work without it. We’re figuring out the source of your connectivity issue, and we’ll fix it as soon as possible.\n 您一定對計算機無法連接到Internet感到非常沮喪。我幾乎需要做的所有事情都需要Internet訪問，所以我知道沒有Internet嘗試工作會有多麼困難。我們正在找出您的連接問題的根源，我們將盡快解決。 \n \n \n 原文: \n As a technician, it’s important to remember that not all customers will have a detailed knowledge of computers. We should use proper language that is simple and concise, not technical jargon that is confusing. If you are dealing with computer novices, it doesn’t help them for you to tell them the reason for their Internet connectivity issue is that “layer 3 of the OSI model is not functioning properly.” Instead, use effective listening principles to hear the customer’s problem, then share that the router isn’t working properly and therefore the customer cannot access the Internet, but you are going to get it fixed for them quickly. You must listen to the customer and clarify the problem. Don’t interrupt the customer, and always ensure you are restating the issue to the customer to confirm your understanding of the problem. \n 翻譯: \n 作為技術人員，重要的是要記住，並非所有客戶都具有計算機的詳細知識。 我們應該使用簡單明了的適當語言，而不要使用容易引起混淆的技術術語。 如果您正在與計算機新手打交道，這並不能幫助他們告訴他們Internet連接問題的原因是“ OSI模型的第3層無法正常運行”。 取而代之的是，使用有效的監聽原理來聽取客戶的問題，然後分享路由器無法正常工作，因此客戶無法訪問Internet，但是您將為他們快速修復它。 您必須聽取客戶的意見並澄清問題。 不要打擾顧客。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Effective Listening.html'}, {'title': 'Listening skills', 'text': '聆聽技巧 \n The example below illustrates effective listening skills. \n 下面的示例說明了有效的聆聽技巧。 \n Representative:  Hello, thank you for calling the Metro Power Company, how may I help you? \n 代表：您好，謝謝您致電都會電力公司，我該如何幫助您？ \n Customer: Hi, I need to report that my power is currently out. \n 客戶：您好，我這裡目前停電 \n Representative: I’m happy to record the outage.

She also thanks the customer for her patience with the outage and provides information on when the power is expected to be turned back on. The customer service representative also asks if the customer has any additional needs and thanks her for reporting the outage.

The employee should also promise to keep the customer informed as to what is happening along the way.

I am so sorry it was totaled in that accident. I am just glad that you were not hurt.\n 我知道你對那輛車有多愛！我很抱歉那次車禍總共累了。我很高興你沒有受傷。 \n \n \n I am so sorry that your favorite vase was broken during the move. I understand that it was your mother’s, and is not something that you can replace. We feel really bad about that. \n 很抱歉，您最喜歡的花瓶在搬家過程中被弄壞了。我知道那是您母親的花瓶，不是您可以更換的東西。對此我們感到非常遺憾。 \n \n I know how disappointing it is that you’ve lost photos on your hard drive due to the lightning storm. I’m sorry that you’re going through this now. I know how much those photos must have meant to you; my photos of the trip I took with my family this summer mean more to me than I can say.\n 我知道您因雷雨而丟失了硬盤驅動器上的照片，這真令人失望。很抱歉您現在正在經歷此事。我知道那些照片一定對您意味著什麼；我的照片今年夏天我與家人的旅行中，對我來說意義重大，莫過於我能說的。 \n \n \n 原文: \n Always follow up with customers after repairs to verify that they are satisfied. This is a good approach for two reasons. First, the customer may be experiencing problems and would appreciate your indication that you are available to help rectify the problem. Second, the customer may have more business or a referral for you, because they were so happy with your performance. This is good customer service and also good business sense! \n 翻譯: \n 維修後請始終與客戶保持聯繫，以確保他們滿意。這是一個好方法，有兩個原因。首先，客戶可能遇到問題，希望您能幫助您解決問題。其次，客戶可能會對您有更多的業務或推薦，因為他們對您的表現非常滿意。這是良好的客戶服務，也具有良好的商業意識！ \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Problem Resolution and Follow-Up.html'}, {'title': 'Proper Treatment of a Customer’s Property', 'text': '原文: \n Customers often entrust their confidential and personal data to you in order to have their devices repaired. Above all, respect the customers and their property. There are fundamental rules a technician should follow when handling a customer’s property: \n 翻譯: \n 客戶通常將他們的機密和個人數據託付給您，以便對其設備進行維修。 首先，尊重客戶及其財產。 技術人員在處理客戶財產時應遵循的基本規則： \n \n \n Do not use a customer’s equipment for personal use. You may have been tasked with setting up email on a customer’s smartphone. That doesn’t give you the right to make personal calls on their phone while it is in your possession. \n 請勿將客戶的設備用於個人用途。您可能被要求在客戶的智能手機上設置電子郵件。這並不意味著您擁有在您擁有的電話上通過電話撥打個人電話的權利。 \n \n Do not look through a device’s storage unless you need to in order to perform the job requested. If a customer asks you to back up all of his documents, it may be necessary to open the documents folder on the hard disk to copy those files over. This would be acceptable, but if he asked for documents and you are browsing through his pictures folder, this is unacceptable and outside the scope of the required job. \n 除非您需要執行請求的作業，否則請勿瀏覽設備的存儲。如果客戶要求您備份所有文檔，則可能有必要打開硬盤上的documents文件夾以復制這些文件。這是可以接受的，但是如果他要文件，而您正在瀏覽他的圖片文件夾，則這是不可接受的，超出了所需工作的範圍。 \n \n Ensure reasonable testing of a device. If you were testing a printer, you should print the minimal amount to verify functionality. There is no need to print 100 pages to verify that a printer works when a single page will suffice. Furthermore, ensure that the content printed is not offensive or personal in nature. \n 確保合理測試設備。如果要測試打印機，則應打印最少的數量以驗證功能。當單頁就足夠時，無需打印100頁即可驗證打印機是否工作。此外，請確保所打印的內容不具有冒犯性或個人性質。 \n \n Return all settings to the customer’s preferences. When you work on someone’s machine or device, return the device with all settings reverted to the customer’s preferences. If the monitor resolution must be changed to accomplish the repair task, ensure the customer’s preferred resolution is restored when the job is complete. \n 將所有設置返回到客戶的首選項。當您在某人的機器或設備上工作時，請返回設備並將所有設置恢復為客戶的首選項。如果必須更改監視器分辨率以完成修復任務，請確保在作業完成後恢復客戶的首選分辨率。 \n \n 原文: \n Above all, respect customers and their property. Remember that you are a customer too; think of how you would like to be treated, and ensure that you treat your customers in this manner. \n 翻譯: \n 首先，要尊重客戶及其財產。請記住，您也是客戶。考慮如何對待您，並確保您以這種方式對待客戶。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Proper Treatment of a Customer’s Property.html'}, {'title': 'Putting it All Together', 'text': '原文: \n Truly exceptional customer service involves surprising and delighting the customer by exceeding his or her expectations. \n The following strategies are effective with all types of customer behavior: \n 翻譯: \n 真正出色的客戶服務涉及超出客戶期望的驚喜和喜悅。 \n 以下策略對所有類型的客戶行為均有效： \n \n \n Warm welcome and friendly smile. \n 熱情的歡迎和友好的微笑。 \n \n Effective listening. \n 有效聆聽。 \n \n Empathy. \n 同情。 \n \n Follow-through and follow-up. \n 跟進和跟進。 \n \n 原文: \n When dealing with customer service, we always want to exceed our customers’ expectations. One key step to accomplishing this is to set and meet the timeline you provide the customer. You need to tell the customer how long the repairs will take, and also if it is worth the cost of the repair. If a customer calls you for a broken laptop screen replacement on a four-year-old laptop, it may be more cost effective for the customer to simply buy a new laptop. \n (NOTE: The rule of thumb for laptop repairs is that if it costs 50 percent or more of the cost of a new laptop, replacement is suggested.) \n 翻譯: \n 與客戶服務打交道時，我們始終希望超越客戶的期望。 完成此任務的關鍵一步是設置並滿足您為客戶提供的時間表。 您需要告訴客戶維修需要多長時間，以及是否值得花費維修費用。 如果客戶要求您更換一台使用四年的舊筆記本電腦的筆記本電腦屏幕壞了，那麼客戶只需購買一台新筆記本電腦可能更具成本效益。 （注意：筆記本電腦維修的經驗法則是，如果筆記本電腦維修費用佔新筆記本電腦成本的50％或以上，則建議更換。） \n 原文: \n When options are available, present them logically with the estimated cost, time to repair, and length of future service of the workstation.
